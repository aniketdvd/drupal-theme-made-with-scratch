# drupal-theme-made-with-scratch

# This is a basic Drupal 8 theme made with bulma.css
* this repo will help you understand the basic stricture of a Drupal theme.
* I have used Normailze and Skeleton CSS in the theme along with a small style.css file used just for changing colors and getting to know that it is being loaded on the theme.
